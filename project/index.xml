      <description>Project 1 - Yujin Song Introduction One of my family member was diagnosed with lung cancer 2 years ago. I was very surprised by that because she was not a smoker, heavy drinker, or having a family history of cancer. Since her life was not even close to all the high risk factors of lung cancer, I thought air pollution might have some effects on her disease. Therefore, I decided to find whether there is a relationship between air pollution and the lung cancer.</description>
